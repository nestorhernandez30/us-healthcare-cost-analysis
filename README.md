📊 Who Pays More for Healthcare?
Exploring U.S. Spending by Income and Insurance Status (MEPS 2019–2022)
A Data Visualization Project by Nestor Hernandez

🧠 Overview:
This Tableau dashboard project explores healthcare expenditure trends in the United States using data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) for the years 2019–2022. The visualizations focus on how income and insurance status influence total spending, out-of-pocket burden, and utilization of care (ER visits, hospital stays, and prescription drug costs).

ER vs. Hospital Use:
Utilization patterns by insurance type, highlighting disparities in care access.

Income & Insurance Effects on Total Spending:
A stacked view showing how both income and insurance shape healthcare expenditures.

🔧 Tools Used:

Notes:
Missing data was handled using regression and iterative imputation.
Insurance groups were recoded into Private, Public, and Uninsured.
All dollar values are reported in nominal terms.

📌 Disclaimer:
The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) is a nationally representative dataset based on a complex survey design. While some weighted estimates (e.g., weighted average expenditure) are included, most analyses and visualizations in this project are unweighted for simplicity and exploratory purposes. This tradeoff allows for a clearer demonstration of analytical and visualization techniques rather than nationally representative inference.
