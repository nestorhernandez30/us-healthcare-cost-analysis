📌 Disclaimer:
Note: The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) data used in this project is based on a complex survey design intended to produce nationally representative estimates. While some analyses in this project apply survey weights to account for this design, others are unweighted for simplicity and exploratory purposes. Users should be cautious when interpreting unweighted results, as they may not accurately reflect national estimates.
